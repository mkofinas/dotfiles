# TODO - Issues

- [ ] DejaVu Nerd Font bold characters (pt. 10) seem somewhat pudgy.
  - The problem seems to (for the most part) disappear when using a font size of
    12 of higher.
- [ ] Installation script seems to have issues overwriting current dotfiles.
- [x] Add [XDG Specifications Compliance][12] when applicable. (see https://github.com/mkofinas/dotfiles/issues/1)
